# Video-game-recommendation-system
The project consists of a recommendation system for video games in which the Steam catalog was examined. The dataset contained more than 70000 games developed and released on steam from 1997. Therefore, the goal of the project was to create a recommendation systema that based on the content of the game or based on the history of the user on the Steam platform. In addition, the evaluation of the results of the system is of high relevance. In addition to the main recomendation system, we wadeted to detect a path between the increase of the development of video games genres based on specific cluster. Thanks to the results of the project would be possible to suggest to the customer (video gamer) the most appropiate game based on their prefernces and at the same time to suggest to each company wich game are more viral based on their user target.

The first pahse was to deterct the paths on the different time periods. To be able to visualize the dataset was necessary to use three different dimensionality reduction (PCA, T-SNE and UMAP). Based on the Elbow and the Silhouette methods was possibel to identify the number of clusters that could be identified. he results of the anaysis bas really ![image](https://github.com/Edoardo24/Video-game-recommendation-system/assets/46709461/f77c52ed-81e8-4f71-bb3a-9f4079440c8c)
